## Show Pictures in Folder

Tumblr Question:

Hi! Could you help me with the programme I'm trying to write? I'm a little stuck. I'm trying to create a programme that will allow show all picture files I have on a folder but I wanted to put them in a list box with the names of them appearing. Could you help me do that? Or point me in the right direction? I'm trying to teach myself programming but this project has made me a little confused. 

SOLVED!

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
